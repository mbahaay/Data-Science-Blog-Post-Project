## Project Description
This project is part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program to show off my gained technical and analytical skills.

In this project, we'll utilize a dataset for different data science-related jobs to draw insights that would help us answer the following questions:

- What are the most in-demand data science-related jobs?
- Do data science jobs require a high level of experience?
- How do salaries compare to the level of experience?
- Are there more job opportunities at large or small companies?
- Are data science jobs suitable for working remotely?

The dataset contains 245 records of anonymous salary information for various data science related jobs during 2020/21. It has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/data-science-jobs-salaries) and was originally collected by [ai-jobs.net](https://salaries.ai-jobs.net/).

The blog for this project is posted in the following [link](https://mbahaay.github.io/course-name/2023/03/06/Can-I-Pursue-a-Career-In-Data-Science.html)
